Summary of Findings
Based on the analysis of the bigquery-public-data.thelook_ecommerce dataset, the following key findings were identified:

Overall Growth Trend: The e-commerce business exhibits a general upward trend in both order volume and revenue over the observed period (2019-2024), with significant year-over-year growth rates.
Product Category Performance: There is a notable difference between product category popularity (total order items) and profitability (total revenue). While 'Intimates' is the most popular, 'Outerwear & Coats' is the most profitable. The 'Jeans' category shows consistent growth and strong performance in higher price ranges.
Customer Segment Behavior: Returning users demonstrate a significantly higher purchase frequency compared to new users, highlighting the importance of customer retention. Popular products purchased by returning users were also identified.
Changes After Validation
Cross-validation efforts reinforced the initial insights:

Growth Trend Validation: Year-over-year growth rate calculations confirmed the positive growth trend in total orders and revenue, providing additional evidence for the overall business expansion.
Returning User Frequency Validation: Calculating the average number of orders for users with more than one order supported the finding that returning users have a higher purchase frequency than new users.
Proposals
Based on the findings and validated insights, the following strategic proposals are made:

Enhance Marketing for High-Value Categories: Focus marketing campaigns and inventory management on product categories that demonstrate high profitability, such as 'Outerwear & Coats' and 'Jeans', particularly targeting the higher price segments within these categories.

Geographic Targeting: Allocate increased marketing spend and resources to top-performing regions like China, the United States, and Brazil to capitalize on existing market strength and maximize sales growth in these areas.
