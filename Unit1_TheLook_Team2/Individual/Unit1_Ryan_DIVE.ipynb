        "*   **Correction:** We identified that the `created_at` column needed to be treated as a DATE for the yearly interval subtraction to work correctly with `DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)`. We modified the query to explicitly cast `orders.created_at` to a DATE using `DATE(orders.created_at)` in the `WHERE` clause.\n",

Refined to cast `created_at` to DATE and use `DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)` for filtering. Also explicitly saved results to `monthly_revenue_df` using `client.query().to_dataframe()` after issues with `%%bigquery -d`. |\n",

No major SQL logic refinement was needed based on errors. |"

            "Regional Overlap:\n",
            "- Both 'Outerwear & Coats' sales and the presence of 'Returning Customers' are highest in China, the United States, and Brasil. This suggests these regions are key markets for both the top-performing category and retaining customers.\n",
            "\n",
            "Traffic Source Overlap:\n",
            "- 'Search' is the leading traffic source for both 'Outerwear & Coats' sales and acquiring 'Returning Customers'. This indicates that customers finding the site through search are more likely to purchase this category and also more likely to become returning customers.\n",
            "\n",
            "Outerwear & Coats and Returning Customer Behavior:\n",
            "- While 'Outerwear & Coats' was not in the top 10 categories for returning customers by item count, it was a top-performing category overall. The fact that returning customers are concentrated in the same top regions and traffic sources as 'Outerwear & Coats' sales suggests an indirect connection. Returning customers in these key areas likely contribute to the overall strong performance of this category, even if it's not their most frequently purchased item type.\n",
            "\n",
            "Discount Impact and Returning Customers:\n",
            "- 'Outerwear & Coats' were primarily sold at full price. The analysis of returning customers did not specifically look at the impact of discounts on their purchases. However, the high repeat purchase rate and AOV for returning customers might suggest that they are less price-sensitive or find value in the products even at full price. Further analysis would be needed to confirm this.\n"
