Based on your analysis of the e-commerce data set, what did you found, what changed after validation, what do you propose for the future?

Overall Growth Trend: In the number of orders, we see a clear upward trend in the orderes placed over time in the e-commerce data set. The ability for a business to continuously grow its output in what its able to accomplish is very important to note and to look into the ways that its able to do that. Continuing to monitor and track how the number of orders is performing over time is important to consider as a business. Positive business growth and increasing customer engagement is important for this business to continue in the future and to capitalize on growth periods.

Disparities in Distribution Center Performance: One insight that I drew from the data was that certain distributions are underperforming compared to others. This is characterized by a lower number of total orders and a higher average shipping time compared to others. This business should conduct deeper investigations into the root causes of this and how the negative performance impacts money and quarterly outputs. This could involve analyzing logistics, staffing, or local market factors and seeing if there are too many distribution centers and how they can minimize costs for the future.

Unequal Distribution of Sales and Orders: The volume of sales and orders are not evenly distributed across all distribution centers, suggesting potential regional variations in demand or operational efficiency. The business needs to examine the reasons behind the unequal distribution of sales and orders across distribution centers. By looking at regional demand, marketing effectiveness in areas, and the product mix available at each center will help in finding ways to minimize these discrepancies.
