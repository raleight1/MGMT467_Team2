The low F1-score confirms that the model is not practically useful for its intended purpose of proactively identifying at-risk customers.

        "1.  **Address Class Imbalance:**\n",
        "    *   Investigate the distribution of `Churn_Label` in the training data. If there's a significant imbalance, consider techniques such as oversampling the minority class (churners) or undersampling the majority class (non-churners). BigQuery ML offers `WEIGHTS` option for class weights or techniques like `STRATIFIED_SPLIT` for balanced training.\n",
        "    *   Focus on evaluation metrics more suitable for imbalanced datasets, such as the Confusion Matrix, Precision-Recall Curve, and Average Precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Explore Alternative Model Types:**\n",
        "    *   Logistic Regression can be sensitive to class imbalance and feature scaling. Consider exploring other BigQuery ML models that might handle these challenges better or capture non-linear relationships, such as:\n",
        "        *   **Boosted Tree (XGBoost):** Often performs well on tabular data and can handle non-linearities and interactions.\n",
        "        *   **Random Forest:** Another robust ensemble method.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Further Feature Engineering:**\n",
        "    *   **Interaction Terms:** Create new features by combining existing ones (e.g., `Age` * `Tenure_Days`).\n",
        "    *   **Time-Series Features from Weather Data:** Instead of just daily averages, incorporate features like `weather_trend` (change in temperature over the last week), `weather_variability` (standard deviation of temperature), or `extreme_weather_events` (binary flag for days above/below certain thresholds).\n",
        "    *   **More Granular Demographic/Activity Features:** If available, include more detailed membership activity data, visit frequency, usage of gym facilities, or personal trainer interactions.\n",
        "    *   **Lagged Features:** Incorporate previous month's churn status or weather conditions as features.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Data Acquisition:**\n",
        "    *   If possible, gather more historical data, especially for churned customers, to provide the model with a richer learning signal for the minority class.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Refine Weather Data Aggregation:**\n",
        "    *   Experiment with different aggregation windows for weather data. For instance, using weekly or bi-weekly averages instead of daily might capture longer-term trends that influence churn more effectively. The `Last_Visit_Date` join might not be the most relevant for weather impact; perhaps averaging weather conditions over a period *before* the `Last_Visit_Date` could be more insightful."

        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   **Data Overview**: The churn prediction model utilized `GymData_Curated` (for batch features like `Churn_Label`, `Tenure_Days`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Membership_Type`) and `Weather_Raw_Streaming` (for aggregated daily weather features like `avg_daily_temperature_c`, `avg_daily_wind_speed_kph`, `avg_daily_relative_humidity`, and `day_proportion`). These datasets were joined on `Last_Visit_Date` and `weather_date` to link member behavior with weather conditions.\n",
        "*   **Model Performance**: The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 0.746667 and a precision of 1.0. However, its recall was very low at 0.025641, resulting in a low F1-Score of 0.05. The ROC AUC was 0.594548, and Log Loss was 0.555046. The perfect precision indicates that when the model predicts churn, it is always correct, but the extremely low recall means it identifies only a very small fraction of actual churners.\n",
        "*   **Feature Importance**:\n",
        "    *   `avg_daily_temperature_c` was the most influential non-intercept feature with a weight of -0.059069, suggesting higher temperatures are associated with a decreased likelihood of churn.\n",
        "    *   `Age` (weight: 0.012715) was the second most influential.\n",
        "    *   `avg_daily_wind_speed_kph` also had a negative weight (-0.011281), indicating a slight decrease in churn with higher wind speeds.\n",
        "    *   `avg_daily_relative_humidity` had a negligible negative weight (-0.000162).\n",
        "    *   `day_proportion` had a zero weight, indicating no contribution to the model's prediction.\n",
        "    *   `Gender` and `Membership_Type` showed `NaN` weights, possibly due to lack of variance in the dataset.\n",
        "*   **Model Limitations**: The primary limitation is the model's very low recall, making it ineffective at proactively identifying most actual churners, thus missing significant intervention opportunities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   **Address Class Imbalance and Model Selection**: The model's low recall and F1-score strongly suggest a significant class imbalance. Future work should prioritize techniques to address this (e.g., oversampling, undersampling, using class weights) and explore alternative BigQuery ML models like Boosted Trees (XGBoost) or Random Forest, which are often more robust to imbalanced data and can capture non-linear relationships.\n",
        "*   **Enhanced Feature Engineering and Data Sourcing**: To improve predictive power, consider generating more sophisticated features, including interaction terms, time-series weather attributes (e.g., weather trends, variability, extreme events), and potentially acquiring more granular member activity data or historical churn data. Refining how weather data is aggregated and linked (e.g., averaging weather conditions over a period *before* the `Last_Visit_Date`) could also yield better insights.\n"
